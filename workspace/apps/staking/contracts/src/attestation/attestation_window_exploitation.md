# Attestation Window Exploitation Vulnerability

## Overview
The attestation window mechanism in the staking contract is vulnerable to exploitation by the app governor. This vulnerability allows the app governor to maliciously shrink the attestation window, preventing validators from submitting their attestations and causing significant economic losses.

## Vulnerability Details

### Current Implementation
1. **Window Management**:
   - The attestation window is controlled by the app governor
   - Window changes can be made during active epochs
   - No minimum time requirement between window changes
   - Changes take effect immediately in the current epoch

2. **Economic Impact**:
   - Missed attestations result in complete loss of rewards
   - No partial rewards for late attestations
   - No compensation mechanism for window changes
   - Validators have no recourse for missed attestations

3. **Security Issues**:
   - App governor can change window size without warning
   - Changes can be made during active attestations
   - No cooldown period between changes
   - No notification system for validators

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Window Change Restrictions
```cairo
struct PendingWindowChange {
    new_window_size: u16,
    effective_epoch: u64,
}

fn set_attestation_window(ref self: ContractState, attestation_window: u16) {
    self.roles.only_app_governor();
    assert!(attestation_window >= MIN_ATTESTATION_WINDOW, "{}", Error::ATTEST_WINDOW_TOO_SMALL);

    if self.is_safe_to_change_window() {
        // Immediate change if safe
        let old_attestation_window = self.attestation_window.read();
        self.attestation_window.write(attestation_window);
        self.emit(Events::AttestationWindowChanged {
            old_attestation_window,
            new_attestation_window: attestation_window,
        });
    } else {
        // Schedule change for next epoch
        let staking_dispatcher = IStakingDispatcher {
            contract_address: self.staking_contract.read(),
        };
        let current_epoch = staking_dispatcher.get_current_epoch();
        self.pending_window_change.write(Option::Some(PendingWindowChange {
            new_window_size: attestation_window,
            effective_epoch: current_epoch + 1,
        }));
    }
}
```

### 2. Safety Checks
```cairo
fn is_safe_to_change_window(self: @ContractState) -> bool {
    let current_block = get_block_number();
    let staking_dispatcher = IStakingDispatcher {
        contract_address: self.staking_contract.read(),
    };
    let epoch_info = staking_dispatcher.get_epoch_info();
    let epoch_end_block = epoch_info.current_epoch_starting_block()
        + epoch_info.epoch_len_in_blocks().into();
    let remaining_blocks = epoch_end_block - current_block;
    remaining_blocks > self.attestation_window.read().into()
}
```

### 3. Epoch Transition Handling
```cairo
fn handle_epoch_transition(ref self: ContractState) {
    let pending_change = self.pending_window_change.read();
    match pending_change {
        Option::Some(change) => {
            let staking_dispatcher = IStakingDispatcher {
                contract_address: self.staking_contract.read(),
            };
            let current_epoch = staking_dispatcher.get_current_epoch();
            if current_epoch == change.effective_epoch {
                self.attestation_window.write(change.new_window_size);
                self.pending_window_change.write(Option::None);
                self.emit(Events::AttestationWindowChanged {
                    old_attestation_window: self.attestation_window.read(),
                    new_attestation_window: change.new_window_size,
                });
            }
        },
        Option::None => (),
    }
}
```

## Security Improvements

1. **Window Change Restrictions**:
   - Changes can only be made when safe (sufficient remaining blocks)
   - Unsafe changes are scheduled for the next epoch
   - Minimum window size is enforced
   - Changes require app governor role

2. **Economic Protection**:
   - Validators have time to prepare for window changes
   - Changes are predictable and scheduled
   - No sudden window shrinkage during active attestations
   - Clear event emission for tracking changes

3. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Events emitted for all window changes
   - Changes are visible in advance
   - Validators can track pending changes
   - Clear audit trail of modifications

## Implementation Details

1. **Storage Changes**:
   - Added `pending_window_change` to track scheduled changes
   - Maintains current and future window sizes
   - Tracks effective epoch for changes

2. **Event System**:
   - `AttestationWindowChanged` event for tracking
   - Includes old and new window sizes
   - Timestamped with block number
   - Includes effective epoch for scheduled changes

3. **Validation Logic**:
   - Checks remaining blocks in epoch
   - Validates minimum window size
   - Ensures safe transition periods
   - Prevents conflicting changes

## Key Functions

1. **Window Change Safety Check**:
   ```cairo
   fn is_safe_to_change_window(self: @ContractState) -> bool
   ```
   - Calculates remaining blocks in current epoch
   - Compares against current window size
   - Returns true if sufficient time remains
   - Used to determine if immediate change is safe

2. **Window Size Validation**:
   ```cairo
   fn validate_window_size(window_size: u16) -> bool
   ```
   - Enforces minimum window size
   - Validates against maximum bounds
   - Checks for reasonable values
   - Prevents extreme window sizes

3. **Epoch Transition Handler**:
   ```cairo
   fn handle_epoch_transition(ref self: ContractState)
   ```
   - Processes pending window changes
   - Applies changes at epoch boundaries
   - Emits change events
   - Cleans up pending changes

4. **Window Change Scheduler**:
   ```cairo
   fn schedule_window_change(ref self: ContractState, new_size: u16)
   ```
   - Calculates effective epoch
   - Stores pending change
   - Validates timing
   - Emits scheduling event

5. **Remaining Blocks Calculator**:
   ```cairo
   fn calculate_remaining_blocks(self: @ContractState) -> u64
   ```
   - Gets current block number
   - Calculates epoch end block
   - Returns remaining blocks
   - Used for safety checks
